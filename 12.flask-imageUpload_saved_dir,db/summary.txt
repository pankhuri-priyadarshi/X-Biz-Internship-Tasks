------------------ Task 1: File Upload and Local Storage (upload.py)-----------------------

1.Objective:To receive a file through an API request and store it in a designated local directory.

2.Process Steps:
   The file is received using a POST request in Postman (form-data, key: file).
   The API checks whether the file is provided and has a valid filename.
   The application ensures that the directory Uploads/ exists.
   If not present, it is created using os.makedirs().
   The uploaded file is saved to the Uploads directory using file.save().

3.Outcome:The file is successfully stored in the local folder with its original filename.



------------------- Task 2: Storing File Metadata into the Database (upload-db.py)-----------------


1.Objective:To record details of each uploaded file into the SQL Server database and given directory too as above.

2.Metadata Stored: Filename, File Size (in bytes), File Extension
  CREATE TABLE upload (
     SlNo INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
     filename VARCHAR(255),
     filesize BIGINT,
     file_extension VARCHAR(50)
   );

3.Process Steps:
   Extract filename using file.filename.
   Determine file extension by splitting on the last period.
   Calculate file size using file.seek() and file.tell().
   Establish a database connection using pyodbc.
   Execute an SQL INSERT query: INSERT INTO upload (filename, filesize, file_extension) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
   The table has an auto-increment primary key, so only metadata fields are inserted (no manual ID handling).

4.Outcome: A new record is created in the upload table for every uploaded file and it is saved in given directory too.
