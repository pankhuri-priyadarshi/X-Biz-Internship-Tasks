---------  Kubernetes Learning Summary - 07/08/2025--------


1. Checked Kubernetes setup using kubectl get nodes and confirmed cluster is active (docker-desktop Ready).
2. Learned about Kubernetes basics — Pod, Node, Cluster, Deployment, Service, and how they work together.
3. Created first Pod using pod-test.yaml (nginx image) and verified with kubectl get pods.
4. Learned meaning of kubectl commands like apply, get, describe, logs, and delete.
5. Created Deployment (deployment.yaml) to run multiple Pods automatically and learned to scale replicas using kubectl scale.
6. Created Service (service.yaml) with type: NodePort to expose Pods outside the cluster.
7. Understood port, targetPort, and NodePort — internal vs external port difference.
8. Opened app in browser using NodePort (e.g., http://localhost:31234).
9. Learned different Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName.
10. Practically saw Kubernetes auto-healing — when a Pod was deleted, a new one auto-created.
11. Understood the real difference between Docker (manual) and Kubernetes (automatic management and scaling).
