---------Integrating 2 images together------(img1,img2--folder)
----------without using compose----

1.Built two separate Flask images (one API service, one client).
2.API image exposed endpoints (Flask on port 5000).
3.Client image consumed API using HTTP requests (Flask on port 8000).
4.Both images built and run separately, tested integration successfully.


-----Integrating through single image (flask & db-redis)----(flask-reddis--folder)
-----with using compose----

1.Created a Flask app container that tracks visit count.
2.Integrated with Redis container for storing hits.
3.Used Docker Compose to run both services (flask + redis) together.
4.Verified integration: Flask app connected to Redis and showed hit count in browser.
